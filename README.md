# Hey there, I'm Merritt (feel free to call me Mer)

I'm a UX Designer with a strong technical background, experienced in crafting user-centric digital experiences across iOS, Android, and responsive web platforms. My design work spans projects for Fortune 100 companies in the financial and pharmaceutical sectors, where I've combined the design thinking framework with data-driven insights and a deep empathy for users to solve complex challenges.

## What Do I Do?

### **Design**
- **User-Centered Approach:** I create visually appealing designs that prioritize meeting user needs. I focus on delivering experiences that are intuitive, accessible, and effective in addressing real-world problems while also looking quite sleek.

### **Code**
- **Bridging the Gap:** I enjoy coding on side projects, which allows me to implement my design vision directly. This dual perspective of both design and development enhances my professional work and personal projects, ensuring that products are not only effective from the UX side of things, but are also technically robust.

### **Project Focus**
- My personal repositories showcase projects that I'm passionate about. Currently, I'm developing two innovative projects in the ski industry.

## Confidential Projects
